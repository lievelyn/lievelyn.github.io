    <h1><a id="about">Hello, I'm Evelyn Li.</a></h1>
    <p>I'm Evelyn, a software engineer with a eye for art, design, and marketing.</p>
    <p>I've always been curious about tech since my childhood when I started playing video games. In my teens, I was able to use the internet to researching any of my interests whether it be learning how to draw or learning a new language. When I learned how to code in high school, it put into perspective what the things I've enjoyed were built out of, and I wanted to be a part of that by creating things that would be enjoyable or useful for others.</p>
    <p>I recently graduated from the University of California, Irvine with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science specializing in Information, and am looking for entry-level full-time opportunities. As a developer, I'm experienced with back-end development and technologies such as coding and databases. I'm also a designer so I'm interested in learning more about front-end development and design.</p>
    <p>Besides coding, I enjoy designing graphics, learning about digital and social media marketing, studying foreign languages, and bullet journaling.</p>

        Empethy is a website created by a team of 6 focused on helping people with mental health issues such as depression and anxiety by allowing users to speak to an AI chatbot and complete calming exercises.

    <div class="full-info">
        <p>I created a personal portfolio website for the Informatics 133 User Interaction Software course at UC Irvine. I conducted user interiews, user testing, and built a website using HTML, CSS, and Javascipt in order to learn about UIs and UX that would appeal to users of my website.

        <p>Fabflix is a movie database website similar to IMDB, build for the Comp Sci 122B Project in Databases and Web Applications course at UC Irvine. It was built in a team of 3 using Java Servlets, JSP, the Bootstrap framework, and a backend server on an AWS Linux server using MySQL to make advanced searches for movies in the database and display movie information.</p>
        <p>It was tested on a local machine with Apache Tomcat and published as a web application on Amazon AWS.</p>

        <p>SmileRun is a web game implemented in Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS using the Microsoft Emotion API. By recognizing the user's facial expression, the player character is able to move within the obstacle course. Within a team of 4, I personally worked on HTML and CSS. This project was built for the AthenaHacks 2017 all-female hackathon at USC and it won the Organizer's Favorite award.</p>
